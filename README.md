For use on the Eastern Sun Resurrected mod for Diablo 2 via the D2RLAN launcher. 

- Should highlight crafting mats
- Should notify in game chat for things to look out for
- This has 3 filter levels, you need to setup a hotkey in D2RHUD to cycle the filter level
  - Leveling = will show just about everything minus crap
  - Strict = shows less crappy bases, gold, etc
  - Very-strict = no blues, no bad bases, no potions, etc

Note: the filter is setup in a way so that if you are using a more strict filter, and cycle to a less strict filter, it should reshow the items being hidden. You will have to walk away a screen and run back for the item labels to redraw.

Contact me on the ESR discord "Ironsquid" if you have any problems or well thought out suggestions. Try reloading game first to troubleshoot issues before contact thanks :)
